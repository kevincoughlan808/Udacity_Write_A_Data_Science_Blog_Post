Udacity Data Science nanodegree - blog post project

# Project Motivation
This project - Write a Data Science Blog Post - is part of the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree.

I used data from the Stack OVerflow 2017 Annual Developer Surey to investigate the below questions:  
1 - How do they reccomend breaking into the field?  
2 - Was there bias involved in their suggestions, specifically here focusing on the ParentEducation column?  
3 - what are the most popular languages that those in the profession have and use?  

# Results
1 - Online courses and Books were the clear leaders  
2 - Those whose parents had completed higher edcation were ~33% more likely to recommend a master's degree to enter the field  
3 - Java, Javascript, C and SQL all had >10% use by professional developers  

My findings can be found in more detail at the post available here
